So one day I decided to write a raytracer. This is the result.

In particular, I haven't heard of any raytracers that are optically correct, and that model or handle thin-film effects well. Much of my thin-film handling code will be based on "Thin Film Optical Filters" by Angus MacLeod.

This is very much a work in progress.
